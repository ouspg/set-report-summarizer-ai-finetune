### Answer: The model shows strong resistance to the following categories of attacks: av_spam_scanning., encoding., latentinjection., leakreplay., literalwhois., metaverse., packaging., promptinject., practical., phrasebook., tap., suicide.- These categories represent gaps in the model’s current safety posture. Continue refining models, rules, and detection layers. Unknown categories or payloads represent areas where the model’s understanding or safety measures are incomplete. Further safeguards, model refinements, or ruleset expansions are required.

l ## Your task: Following the structure of the training dataset, generate a complete report for the given JSON. Ensure that you follow these rules:

1. Start with an overview including model type, model name, and run ID.
2. For each probe in the JSON:
  - Show its classname and description.
  - List evaluation results in the format: "- Detector: Passed X/Y tests (Z%) — Outcome".
3. Include a final summary at the end about which categories the model resisted and which require attention.
4. Only summarize what is present in the JSON; do not invent probes or evaluation results.
5. Follow the exact indentation and formatting style of the training dataset.

Here is the JSON to summarize:
