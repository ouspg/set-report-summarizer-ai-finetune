## Issue Summary:
The Security Evaluation Tests presented vulnerabilities related to cached GCG suffix jailbreak attempts, full variants of observed DAN jailbreaks, ethical linguistic misuse, exploitation of audio-format ambiguities, continued slur usage, and continuation boundary issues.

### Remediation Recommendation:
Apply continuation boundary enforcement, implement input validation and format enforcement, enforce instruction hierarchy, detect intentions, filter outputs, and ensure overall robustness through these measures."

## Issue Summary:
The Security Evaluation Tests presented weaknesses in general test patterns, repetition divergence, and PAIR reasoning due to vulnerabilities in instruction hierarchies, output inconsistencies, and lack of intent detection.

### Remediation Recommendation:
Apply instruction hierarchy enforcement, implement output consistency controls, and utilize intent detection with output filtering to address these issues."
